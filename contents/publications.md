1. **Humanoid Control Research, Supervised by Prof. He Kong SUSTech, Sep.2025-present**  

• **My Focus**: Developing whole-body trajectory tracking for High Torque Mini Pi+ humanoid robot using Physics-Based Humanoid Control (PBHC), achieving high-fidelity motion reproduction and enhanced disturbance rejection capabilities;  

• **Lab Research**: Implementing AMP-based adversarial motion priors for Unitree G1 and AgiBot A2 humanoids, enabling natural bipedal walking and running gaits through imitation learning from human motion capture data;  

• **Lab Research**: Conducting blind locomotion research over challenging terrains including uneven surfaces and stair climbing, utilizing proprioceptive sensing and robust control policies without external perception.  [[Code]]

3. **HumanUp Reproduction,Independent Research,Jul.2025**  

• Reproduced the paper, Learning Getting-Up Policies for Real-World Humanoid Robots;  

• Migrated the original IsaacGym training environment to IsaacLab DirectRL, introducing curriculum learning with standing probability and pulling forces to enable successful humanoid stand-up;  

• Improved trajectory following by replacing early termination with height-based rewards and adding proportional pulling-force curriculum, achieving gradual upright motion;  

• Converted environment to ManagerBasedRL structure and retrained in UnitreeLab, validating sim-to-sim transfer with successful stand-up in MuJoCo simulation. [[Code]]

4. **Relationship Between Mars Rover Sinking and Slip Rates,Supervised by Prof. Zhenzhong Jia SUSTech,Jun.2024-Sept.2024**  

• Designed a single-wheeled Mars rover powered by two motors. One motor is used to drive the rotation of the wheel, while the other motor controls the rover’s horizontal movement along a straight track;  

• Tested the Mars rover on smooth sand and successfully changed the slip rate by adjusting the moving speed of the track with the wheel speed;  

• Designed several experiments, including using a cable sensor to measure the actual vertical sinking distance of the wheel, as well as capturing point cloud data of the wheel’s contact area with the sand using a depth camera mounted on the rover to calculate the sinking distance.  [[Code]]
