1.**Little Drummer Bot,UC Berkeley 2024 Fall Semester,Course of Mechatronics Design**  

• Designed a robotic device that controls a drumstick that plays the drums, involving components (ESP32,gears, springs, horizontal and vertical linkages);

•Completed the full assembly CAD and 3D Printed CAD. <a href="https://github.com/ShengzhangXu/Little_Drummer_Bot" target="_blank" >Code</a>

2. **Model Predictive Controller for Double Inverted Pendulum on a Cart,UC Berkeley 2024 Fall Semester,Course of Experimental Advanced Control Design I**  

• Performed modeling using Lagrangian mechanics, producing a system of nonlinear differential equations consisting of three second-order equations;

• Transformed this system of equations into a usual form of six first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for control design purposes;
• Solved the swing-up problem using a Model Predictive Controller (MPC).<a href="https://github.com/ShengzhangXu/Model_Predictive_Controller" target="_blank" >Code</a>

3. **Predicting Lower Limb Motion from Waist IMU Data,SUSTech 2025 Spring Semester,Course of Sensing Principles**  

• Developed a Transformer-based deep learning model to predict lower limb joint angles in real-time using waist-mounted IMU sensors;

• Implemented synchronized data collection with optical motion capture and IMU systems during treadmill walking at multiple speeds (0.5-1.0 m/s);

• Achieved ~1° MAE prediction accuracy using only 4 waist IMUs, enabling portable rehabilitation applications.<a href="https://github.com/ShengzhangXu/Predicting-Lower-Limb-Motion" target="_blank" >Code</a>
